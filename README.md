Fully local [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for [Petlibro](https://petlibro.com/) automatic pet feeders over MQTT. No cloud, no Petlibro app, no internet required after initial Wi-Fi setup.

## How It Works

Petlibro feeders communicate with `mqtt.us.petlibro.com` over unencrypted MQTT (port 1883). By redirecting that hostname to a local MQTT broker via DNS, the feeder talks directly to your Home Assistant instance instead of the cloud.

This integration:

1. Connects to your local MQTT broker
2. Speaks the Petlibro MQTT protocol to your feeder
3. Exposes all feeder controls and sensors as Home Assistant entities

## Supported Devices

| Model | Status |
|-------|--------|
| PLAF203 / PLAF203S | Tested |
| PLAF301 | Tested |
| Other models | Should work |

> The auto-detect setup flow captures your feeder's MQTT credentials directly from its connection attempt — no manual credential entry or firmware sniffing needed. The credentials (product key and secret) are [hard-coded per model in the firmware](https://securelist.com/smart-pet-feeder-vulnerabilities/110028/) and identical across all devices of the same model.

## Features

### Sensors
- Battery level, Wi-Fi signal strength (RSSI)
- Motor state, feeding status, error codes
- Last feed type and portions dispensed
- Firmware version, power mode/type
- SD card capacity and usage

### Controls
- **Buttons** — Dispense food, reboot, factory reset
- **Switches** — LED light, sound, camera, audio, video recording, cloud recording, motion/sound detection, auto button lock
- **Numbers** — Dispense portion count (1-20), volume (0-100%)
- **Selects** — Night vision mode, camera resolution, video record mode, motion detection range/sensitivity, sound detection sensitivity

### Monitoring
- **Binary sensors** — Online status, food level, grain outlet blocked
- **Events** — Feeding lifecycle (started, complete, blocked), device errors

### Feeding Schedule Card

A custom Lovelace card for managing your feeder's schedule directly from the HA dashboard:

- **Weekly calendar overview** — See all feeding times across the week at a glance
- **9 feeding slots** — View, add, edit, or delete individual feeding plans inline
- **Per-slot controls** — Time picker, portion spinner (1-20), day-of-week toggles, audio toggle
- **Day presets** — Quick buttons for "Every day", "Weekdays", "Weekends"
- **Quick Setup** — Automatically create evenly-spaced plans (e.g., every 8 hours starting at 8 AM)
- **Theme-aware** — Follows your HA theme colors and supports dark mode

See [Feeding Schedule Card Setup](#feeding-schedule-card) below.

### Services
- `petlibro_local.manual_feed` — Dispense a specific number of portions
- `petlibro_local.set_feeding_plan` — Create/update a feeding schedule (time, portions, days, audio)
- `petlibro_local.remove_feeding_plan` — Remove a specific feeding plan by slot number
- `petlibro_local.clear_feeding_plans` — Remove all feeding schedules

## Prerequisites

1. **Home Assistant MQTT integration** — [Mosquitto add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md) installed and configured in HA
2. **DNS redirect** — Point `mqtt.us.petlibro.com` to your HA/Mosquitto IP

### DNS Redirect

The feeder resolves `mqtt.us.petlibro.com` to find its MQTT server. Override this to point to your HA/Mosquitto IP.

| Method | Difficulty | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Router/firewall DNS override** | Easy | OPNsense, pfSense, UniFi, OpenWrt — add a host override entry |
| **[AdGuard Home add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home)** | Easy | Filters > DNS Rewrites > add `mqtt.us.petlibro.com` > broker IP |
| **[Dnsmasq add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/dnsmasq/DOCS.md)** | Medium | Official HA add-on — add a `hosts` entry in the add-on config |
| **Pi-hole** | Medium | Local DNS Records > add hostname > IP mapping |

> **Note**: If using a DNS add-on on HA (AdGuard, Dnsmasq), your router's DHCP settings must hand out HA's IP as the DNS server so the feeder resolves through it.

Mosquitto login credentials are **automatically configured** by the integration during setup — no manual credential entry needed.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots menu > **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/erosen14/petlibro_local` as an **Integration**
4. Search for "Petlibro Local" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/erosen14/petlibro_local/releases)
2. Copy the `custom_components/petlibro_local` folder to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Setup

Add the integration via **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration > Petlibro Local**.

The config flow offers two paths:

### Auto-detect (recommended)

Requires the feeder to already be connected to your local Mosquitto broker (DNS redirect + login configured).

1. Select **Auto-detect from MQTT**
2. Click Submit — the integration first checks the existing MQTT broker for your feeder
3. If the feeder isn't found, it temporarily stops Mosquitto and captures your feeder's MQTT credentials directly from its connection attempt (~2 minutes)
4. Credentials are automatically added to Mosquitto and the broker is restarted
5. Confirm the discovered serial number

> **Note:** After setup, the feeder may take up to 2 minutes to reconnect and start reporting data.

### Manual entry

1. Select **Enter credentials manually**
2. Enter your device serial number, model, and MQTT credentials (DL_PRODUCT_KEY / DL_PRODUCT_SECRET)

## Feeding Schedule Card

The integration includes a custom Lovelace card for managing feeding schedules. The card JS is automatically served by the integration — you just need to register it as a resource and add it to a dashboard.

### 1. Add the resource

Go to **Settings > Dashboards > Resources** (three-dot menu, top right) and add:

| URL | Type |
|-----|------|
| `/petlibro_local/petlibro-feeding-card.js` | JavaScript Module |

### 2. Add the card to a dashboard

Edit any dashboard, click **Add Card**, and search for **Petlibro Feeding Schedule**. Select your feeding schedule sensor entity (e.g., `sensor.petlibro_515b0b_feeding_schedule`).

Or add it manually via YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:petlibro-feeding-card
entity: sensor.petlibro_515b0b_feeding_schedule
```

### Options flow (alternative)

You can also manage feeding schedules through the integration's options flow: go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Petlibro Local > Configure**.

## Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.petlibro_local: debug
```

## Known Limitations

- **Camera/audio streaming** is not supported — the device uses ThroughTek's Kalay SDK (proprietary cloud video platform) which cannot be easily replicated locally
- **OTA firmware updates** are not implemented
- **Feeding audio** may cause a device reboot if the audio file URL is unreachable — disable feeding audio via the sound switch if your feeder has no internet access

## Acknowledgments

This integration builds on the protocol reverse engineering work from the [plaf203](https://github.com/icex2/plaf203) project by [@icex2](https://github.com/icex2). That project documented the full Petlibro MQTT protocol, message formats, and topic structure as an AppDaemon prototype. The protocol layer in this integration is derived from that research.

Security research by [Kaspersky Securelist](https://securelist.com/smart-pet-feeder-vulnerabilities/110028/) confirmed that MQTT credentials are hard-coded per device model in smart pet feeder firmware — a vulnerability class shared across brands including Petlibro.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The most impactful way to help:

- **Test on different models** — The auto-detect flow captures credentials automatically from any Petlibro feeder
- **Report issues** — File bugs or feature requests on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/erosen14/petlibro_local/issues)
